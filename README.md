<h2>👋 Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Hey! I'm Mor, a Junior Full Stack Developer. I built this app while taking a course at Coding Academy. I understand that life isn't always easy, so I created this Meme Generator to help us all laugh a bit more. It's crafted with pure Vanilla JavaScript and utilizes the canvas element for a fun and interactive meme-creating experience.

<h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>

  No special instructions for download needed as it's purely JavaScript and CSS.
